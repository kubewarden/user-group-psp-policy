# Kubewarden policy user-group-psp

This Kubewarden Policy is a replacement for the Kubernetes Pod Security Policy
that controls containers [user and
groups](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#users-and-groups).

This policy is used to control users and groups in containers.

## Settings

The policy has three settings:

- `run_as_user`: Controls which user ID the containers are run with. As well as
  the user in the securityContext from PodSpec.
- `run_as_group`: Controls which primary group ID the containers are run with.
  As well as the group in the securityContext from PodSpec.
- `supplemental_groups`: Controls which group IDs containers add.
- `validate_container_image_configuration`: A boolean value that allows the
  policy to validate the `USER` directive in the container image configuration.
  The default value is `false`.

> [!WARNING] When container image validation is enabled, the policy fetches
> the container image metadata from the container registry. This involves
> network access that affects the policy evaluation time. When the network
> request is particularly slow, the policy evaluation will be interrupted by
> the Policy Server and the request will be rejected. The timeout can occur on
> the first request or whenever the cached response is expired.
>
> If necessary, the policy evaluation interruption can be turned off or tuned
> to accommodate slow network responses. For more details, check [this
> section](https://docs.kubewarden.io/reference/policy-evaluation-timeout#configuration)
> of the Kubewarden documentation.

All three settings have no defaults, just like the deprecated PSP (also, they
would get used if `mutating` is `true`).

All three settings are JSON objects composed by three attributes: `rule`,
`ranges` and `overwrite`. The `rule` attribute defines the strategy used by the
policy to enforce users and groups used in containers. The available strategies
are:

- `run_as_user`:
  - `MustRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified. Uses the minimum
    value of the first range as the default. Validates against all ranges.
  - `MustRunAsNonRoot` - Requires that the pod be submitted with a non-zero
    `runAsUser` or have the `USER` directive defined (using a numeric UID) in the
    image. Pods which have specified neither `runAsNonRoot` nor `runAsUser`
    settings will be mutated to set `runAsNonRoot=true`, thus requiring a defined
    non-zero numeric `USER` directive in the container. No default provided.
  - `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `runAsUser` to be specified.
- `run_as_group`:
  - `MustRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified. Uses the minimum
    value of the first range as the default. Validates against all ranges.
  - `MayRunAs` - Does not require that `RunAsGroup` be specified. However, when
    `RunAsGroup` is specified, they have to fall in the defined range.
  - `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `runAsGroup` to be specified.
- `supplemental_groups`:
  - `MustRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified. Uses the minimum
    value of the first range as the default. Validates against all ranges.
  - `MayRunAs` - Requires at least one range to be specified. Allows
    `supplementalGroups` to be left unset without providing a default. Validates
    against all ranges if `supplementalGroups` is set.
  - `RunAsAny` - No default provided. Allows any `supplementalGroups` to be
    specified

The `ranges` is a list of JSON objects with two attributes: `min` and `max`.
Each range object define the user/group ID range used by the rule.

`overwrite` attribute can be set `true` only with the rule `MustRunAs`. This
flag configure the policy to mutate the `runAsUser` or `runAsGroup` despite of
the value present in the request. Even if the value is a valid one. The default
value of this attribute is `false`.

The `validate_container_image_configuration` configuration in the policy
settings is a boolean value that allows the policy to validate the `USER`
directive in the container image. The default value is `false`. If set to
`true`, the policy will enforce the same rules as `MustRunAs` and
`MustRunAsNonRoot` for the `run_as_user`. And checks if the group of the
`USER` directive is in the `run_as_group` range.

> [!NOTE] Container image validation is skipped if the container image is a
> Windows container. And user and groups names are not allowed. The user and
> group should be defined as uid and gid.

This policy can inspect Pod resources, but can also operate against "higher
order" Kubernetes resources like Deployment, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet,
ReplicationController, Job and CronJob.

It's up to the operator to decide which kind of resources the policy is going
to inspect. That is done when declaring the policy.

There are pros and cons to both approaches:

- Have the policy inspect low level resources, like Pod. Different kind of
  Kubernetes resources (be them native or CRDs) can create Pods. By having the
  policy target Pod objects, there's the guarantee all the Pods are going to be
  compliant. However, this could lead to some confusion among end users of the
  cluster: their high level Kubernetes resources would be successfully created,
  but they would stay in a non reconciled state. For example, a Deployment
  creating a non-compliant Pod would be created, but it would never have all its
  replicas running. The end user would have to do some debugging to finally
  understand why this is happening.
- Have the policy inspect higher order resource (e.g. Deployment): the end
  users will get immediate feedback about the rejections. However, there's still
  the chance that some non compliant pods are created by another high level
  resource (be it native to Kubernetes, or a CRD).

### Examples

To enforce that user and groups must be set and it should be in the defined ranges:

```yaml
run_as_user:
  rule: MustRunAs
  ranges:
    - min: 1000
      max: 1999
    - min: 3000
      max: 3999
run_as_group:
  rule: MustRunAs
  ranges:
    - min: 1000
      max: 1999
    - min: 3000
      max: 3999
supplemental_groups:
  rule: MustRunAs
  ranges:
    - min: 1000
      max: 1999
    - min: 3000
      max: 3999
```

To allow any user and group:

```yaml
run_as_user:
  rule: RunAsAny
run_as_group:
  rule: RunAsAny
supplemental_groups:
  rule: RunAsAny
```

To force running the container with non root user but any group:

```yaml
run_as_user:
  rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
run_as_group:
  rule: RunAsAny
supplemental_groups:
  rule: RunAsAny
```

To enforce a group when the container has some group defined

```yaml
run_as_user:
  rule: RunAsAny
run_as_group:
  rule: MayRunAs
  ranges:
    - min: 1000
      max: 2000
    - min: 2001
      max: 3000
supplemental_groups:
  rule: MayRunAs
  ranges:
    - min: 1000
      max: 2000
    - min: 2001
      max: 3000
```

To enforce that user and groups will be the defined one in the policy configuration,
set `overwrite` as `true`:

```yaml
run_as_user:
  rule: MustRunAs
  overwrite: true
  ranges:
    - min: 1000
      max: 1999
run_as_group:
  rule: MustRunAs
  overwrite: true
  ranges:
    - min: 1000
      max: 1999
supplemental_groups:
  rule: MustRunAs
  overwrite: true
  ranges:
    - min: 1000
      max: 1999
```
